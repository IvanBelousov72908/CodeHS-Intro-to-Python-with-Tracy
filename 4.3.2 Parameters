Why are parameters useful?
- They allow us to tailor functions to be used in multiple situations

How many parameters can we use in each function?
- As many as we need

What is the best way to write a program that uses parameters to draw a square with sides that are 50 pixels long?
- def make_square(length):
  for i in range(4):
    forward(length)
    left(90)

make_square(50)
