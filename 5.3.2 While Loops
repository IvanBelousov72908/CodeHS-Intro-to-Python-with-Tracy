Why do we use while loops?
- To repeat code when the number of times to repeat is unknown

How is an infinite loop created?
- By using a condition that will never become false in a while loop 

What will happen when this code is run? 
1 radius = 20
2 while radius < 50:
3     circle(radius)
- An infinite loop will occur.

What will the output of the following code be? 
1 distance = 100
2
3 while distance >= 10:
      forward(distance) 
      left(90) 
      distance = distance - 10
