- Store information to use in our programs

Which program will have Tracy move forward 10, then turn left and move forward 20?
- distance = 10
 forward(distance)
 left(90)
 distance = distance * 2
 forward(distance)

Which of the following programs would produce this output? 
- square_length = 20

  for i in range(4):
    for i in range(4):
        forward(square_length)
        left(90)
    square_length = square_length * 2
