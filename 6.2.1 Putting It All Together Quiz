Suppose you write a function. How many times can you call the function in your code?
- As many times as you want

In which of the following situations would it be best to make a function?

Which of the following pieces of code will make Tracy do the following actions three times: go forward, change colors, and then turn around.
-   forward(30)
    color("blue")
    left(180)

    forward(30)
    color("green")

Which of the following is NOT a command you can give to Tracy?
- turn

Which of the statements below is true about indentation in Python?
- Indentation always matters in Python. Every statement must be aligned correctly.

Which of the following statements are true about for loops?
A. By default, the range function starts at 0
B. Using for i in range(4) will result in i taking the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
C. For loops let you repeat something any number of times
D. Statements in a for loop do not need to be indented
E. It is not possible to have the range values count 6, 12, 18, 24
F. It is not possible to have the range values count 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
- A, C, and F

Which of the following functions is defined correctly?
- def draw_edge():
    forward(100)
    left(90)

Which of the following is NOT a purpose of using functions?
- Functions let you execute code a fixed number of times.

What is the difference between defining and calling a function?
- Defining a function means you are teaching the computer a new word. Calling a function means you are commanding the computer to complete defined actions.

What does the number in the parentheses in a forward or backward command represent?
- How far Tracy is supposed to move

What control structure would be best to use in the following code?
backward(100)
right(90)
backward(100)
right(90)
backward(100)
right(90)
backward(100)
right(90)
- A for loop

Which of the following commands can be used to turn Tracy to face North if she is initially facing South?
- right(180)

Which program below includes no errors?
- # Draw a square
for i in range(4):
    left(90)
    forward(90)

Which of the following commands can NOT be used to draw one square?
- for i in range(4):
    circle(50, 360, 4)

What shape will be drawn with the following command?
circle(50, 360, 3)
- A triangle

How can we use variable to control the size of a circle?
- radius = 50
  circle(radius)

Can a userâ€™s input control the size of a circle? If so, how?
- Yes
  radius = int(input("Radius: ")) 

  circle(radius)

What is the most effective way to draw three circles in a row of different colors?
- def draw_circle(color_choice):
    pendown()
    color(color_choice)
    begin_fill()
    circle(50)
    end_fill()
    penup()
    forward(100)
draw_circle("red")
draw_circle("blue")
draw_circle("yellow")

What will be the output of the following program?
for i in range(3, 7, 2):
    circle(50, 360, i)
- Two shapes- a triangle (3 sides) and a pentagon (5 sides).

What will be the radii of the circles drawn from the following code?
for i in range(10, 55, 10):
    circle(i)
- 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

Which command will Tracy perform when given the following code?
count = 200
count = count + 1
if count % 2 == 0:
     forward(count)
backward(count)
- backward(201)

Which command will Tracy perform when given the following code?
count = 5
count = count * 2
if count < 10:
     forward(count)
elif count < 20:
    backward(count)
else:
    circle(count)
- backward(10)

What will be the output of the following code?
count = 5
while count > 0:
    circle(50)
    forward(100)
- An infinite loop will occur
