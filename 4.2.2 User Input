How would I collect a number from the user to use for the radius of a circle?
- radius = int(input("What is the radius?: "))

What is the correct way to ask a user for a color and store the answer as a variable?
- user_color = input("Give a color: ")

The name color cannot be used for our variable because:
- The word color is already used as a Tracy command
